The **Stellar Atlas** is an ongoing personal project that explores the life cycles of stars through computational simulations using [MESA](http://mesa.sourceforge.net) (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics). The project aims to visualize how stars of different initial masses and metallicities evolve over time—tracking their paths through the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, changes in internal structure, and core conditions.

This atlas is organized as a grid of stellar models, each simulated under consistent physical assumptions. Stars are evolved from the pre-main sequence phase to key terminal stages, such as hydrogen or helium exhaustion, depending on the case.

## Scientific Background

Stellar evolution is primarily governed by a star’s **initial mass** and **chemical composition** (metallicity). These two factors influence the duration of nuclear burning stages, the types of elements synthesized in the core, and the ultimate fate of the star—whether it becomes a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole.

- **Low-mass stars** (≲ 2 M☉) burn hydrogen slowly and typically end their lives as white dwarfs after ascending the red giant branch.
- **Massive stars** (≳ 8 M☉) proceed through multiple stages of nuclear burning, synthesizing heavier elements up to iron before collapsing in a supernova.
- **Metallicity** affects opacities, mass loss rates, and the balance of radiation pressure, further influencing the evolutionary path.

MESA provides a detailed and modular framework to simulate these processes with high physical fidelity.

## Project Goals

The main goals of the Stellar Atlas are:

- To simulate a range of stellar masses and metallicities using MESA.
- To document and compare the evolution of various stars through structured outputs.
- To provide visualizations and data that can support both learning and research.
- To eventually make this dataset and report publicly available via Zenodo and a personal website.

## Status

The first phase—running and analyzing solar-metallicity stars across a mass range of 0.8–100 M☉—is complete. The project is currently being documented in a formal report written in Typst, and the data will be archived on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) with open access.

Future phases will include stars of varying metallicities and enhancements to the web presentation.
