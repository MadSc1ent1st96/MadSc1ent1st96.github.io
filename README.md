# 👋 Hi, I'm Aniket Mishra (MadSc1ent1st96)!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I’m a Physics major at [IISER Kolkata](https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/), currently between my second and third year of the Integrated BS-MS program (Physics Major). I’m on an endless quest to understand the universe, one simulation, plot, or event at a time.
