Here, I share the codes and resource I used to learn the following coding languages:

### 1. **C++** :   
I learned C++ from a youtube playlist from 'CodeWithHarry'. It's a good playlist to learn C++, as though in colleges. The link to the playlist is - [CodeWithHarry C++ playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agpFUAlPFe_VNSlXW5uE0YL&si=FVimYizPpAqWqE_N)
  
  
The codes I wrote while learning C++ is available at - [GitHub link or google drive link](). Even though it would be awfully similar with CodeWithHarry's.

### 2. **FORTRAN** :   

There are not much resources like a proper course-like video for Fortran and hence I used ChatGPT and a website - [Fortran Lang](https://fortran-lang.org/learn/) to learn the language. I first got curious about this language when I explored MESA. As I wanted to know about the various files in the working directory and understand exactly what was the stuff I was editing in the inlist file, I decided to learn a bit about Fortran. The codes are available at - [Github link or drive link](). I have added additional comments in the codes and written some theory so that I could revise the language by reading the files. The codes should be interpratable by someone new to the language if you know any other programming language,
