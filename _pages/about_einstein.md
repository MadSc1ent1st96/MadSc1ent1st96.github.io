I'm **Aniket Mishra**, a third-year BS-MS student at IISER Kolkata. My academic interests lie mainly in **astrophysics**, particularly **stellar structure and evolution**, and in using **computational tools** to study physical systems.

I enjoy working independently on projects that combine theoretical concepts with numerical simulations. One such project is the _Stellar Evolution Atlas_, a collection of MESA-based stellar models aimed at exploring how mass and metallicity influence stellar evolution.

Outside academics, Iâ€™m involved in organizing student events and occasionally work on science outreach.
